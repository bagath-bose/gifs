  <h1> computer</h1>
   <ul>
   <li>A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of models of arithmetic or logical operations automatically</li>
   <li>Modern computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks</li>
   <li>Early computers were meant to be used only for calculations</li>
   <li>Simple manual instruments like the abacus have aided people in doing calculations since ancient times</li>
   <li>The first semiconductor transistors in the late 1940s were followed by the silicon-based MOSFET (MOS transistor) and monolithic integrated circuit</li>
   <li>Conventionally, a modern computer consists of at least one processing element, typically a central processing unit</li>
   <li>A broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems</li>
   </ul>
